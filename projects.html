	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>Like any programmer, I've had plenty of half-baked ideas in my spare time, but here are a few clean enough for public viewing.</p>
	<h2>rjd</h2>
	<p>A lightweight cross-platform game engine written in C11.</p>
	<p>This started as an experiment in how to do things without any of the object-oriented or RAII paradigms of C++, and I quickly fell in love with the simplicity and cognitive load of C. It's still in active development as I add more features to the library when I feel sufficiently motivated.</p>
	<p>I'm bad at naming things, so I took a cue from the stb libraries and just used my initials.</p>

	<h2>rjd-samples</h2>
	<p>Samples showing off features of the rjd APIs.</p>

	<h2>zig-slotmap</h2>
	<p>Zig is a great up-and-coming language with the potential to replace C. While writing a small asteroids game with it, I needed a handle-based, contiguous-memory data structure. I decided to publish a small standalone library that other people could use in their own projects.</p>
	<p>The slotmap data structure has been around for a very long time in concept and implementation, but there hasn't been a common name until recently, where the name "Slotmap" seems to have won the popular vote.</p>
