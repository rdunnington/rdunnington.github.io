		<li> Created and drove Unreal upgrade process, coordinating stakeholders across the studio to ensure minimal disruption. "Smoothest engine upgrade I've seen in my career" - Principal Tech Artist Matt Canei.</li>
		<li> Created optimization plan highlighting effort-to-reward. Implemented character and replication optimizations, bringing single-threaded server frametime down from 54.97ms avg (141ms max) to 21.83ms avg (62ms max).</li>
		<li> Championed and drove debug menu adoption across the studio. Integrated and <a href=" https://github.com/believer-oss/UnrealImGui" target="_blank">modified Imgui</a> to work seamlessly in a client-server environment.</li>

UGS parity with game/engine syncing for content creators. Rust-based external tooling. OFPA name translation. Optimizations for <a href=" https://github.com/believer-oss/FriendshipperSourceControl" target="_blank">Unreal plugin</a> bringing ops from 20s to 0.5s, and batched locking 1000x faster in DynamoDB (1500s to 1.5s).</li>
		<li> From-scratch <a href=" https://github.com/believer-oss/Untested" target="_blank">OSS code testing framework</a>, with Slate UI test runner. Code tests have native coroutine support. Unit, "world", and client-server tests for guaranteeing replicated behavior.</li>
		<li> OpenTelemetry library integration and <a href=" https://github.com/believer-oss/UnrealOpenTelemetry" target="_blank">OSS plugin</a> featuring spans, metrics, and events. Built-in editor, map, and PIE load timing observability.</li>
		<li> Mentored interns, junior, and senior engineers. No gameplay or systems experience to effective Unreal C++ developers in ~6 months. Code reviews, “mob” programming, and quick feedback loops to accelerate learning.</li>

	</div>
	<ul>
		<li> Identified and optimized both code and data sources of Unreal game thread perf problems across a variety of different systems. Champion for workflow iteration times, improving PIE performance from 45ms down to 15ms, map load times from 5+ mins to ~30s, and out-of-process PIE startup times from 30+ mins to ~1 min.</li>
		<li> Wrote custom tooling and debug systems to support content creators' specific needs around animation, world building, audio (Wwise), and gameplay systems. Extended existing Unreal systems with new UI and hotkeys.</li>
		<li> Owned the full stack of NPC AI, locomotion, and animation systems, implementing behavior tree-driven, designer-tweakable, custom movement abilities synced with animation in a networked environment.</li>
		<li> Extended the Houdini Engine for Unreal plugin to leverage native landscape spline curves for procgen roads.</li>
		<li> Champion for test automation, extending the native Unreal framework to simplify writing tests, creating multiple code and BP-oriented tests to lead by example, and integrated them with our automated Jenkins pipeline.</li>
		<li> Leveraged Unreal replication and RepGraph, minimizing net traffic while providing a compelling real-time, debuggable experience on the client for gameplay systems such as destruction and AI-oriented functionality.</li>
		<li> Fixed crashes and critical bugs in various engine-level systems, such as World Partition, Level Instances, UObject, Navigation, Input, Animation, and Gameplay Ability System.</li>

	<ul>
		<li> Ported Slipspace engine, tools, and CI to prerelease Xbox Series X hardware, OS, and SDK. Worked closely with the platform team providing kernel and SDK feedback, testing, and bug reports. Managed rollout to 500+ people.</li>
		<li> Aggressively profiled and optimized memory for many systems in different parts of the engine, saving hundreds of megs that allowed the memory-constrained Xbox One title to ship and increasing Mean-Time-To-Failure over 4x (46.6 to 197.6 mins).</li>
		<li> Owned all engine-level memory APIs, creating new in-engine and standalone tools for memory analysis, improving existing tracking features, and hooking telemetry support for continuous integration visiblity.</li>
		<li> Profiled and implemented optimizations for major perf bottlenecks in the asset pipeline's asset metadata system, in some cases shaving hours off nightly build times.</li>
		<li> Upgraded tools, asset pipeline, and infrastructure to support external studios. Enabled multiple codevelopment partners to be able to work on code and assets worldwide, which before would have been impossible.</li>
